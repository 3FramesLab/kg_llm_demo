# KPI Executive Summary: Data Quality & Reconciliation Monitoring

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive KPI framework for monitoring data quality and reconciliation effectiveness in the DQ-POC system. Three strategic KPIs have been designed to provide actionable insights into system performance, data quality, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 The 3 Strategic KPIs

### 1️⃣ Reconciliation Coverage Rate (RCR)
**Measures**: What percentage of source data is successfully matched?

- **Current Value**: 95.92%
- **Target**: ≥90%
- **Status**: ✅ HEALTHY
- **Frequency**: Real-time
- **Business Impact**: Identifies data gaps and unmatched records

### 2️⃣ Data Quality Confidence Score (DQCS)
**Measures**: How confident are we in the matched data?

- **Current Value**: 86.2%
- **Target**: ≥80%
- **Status**: ✅ GOOD
- **Frequency**: Hourly
- **Business Impact**: Measures reliability of reconciliation results

### 3️⃣ Reconciliation Efficiency Index (REI)
**Measures**: How efficiently is the system processing data?

- **Current Value**: 40.8
- **Target**: ≥40
- **Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE
- **Frequency**: 6-hourly
- **Business Impact**: Identifies performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Daily Monitoring
**Scenario**: Operations team reviews KPIs each morning

```
1. Check RCR trend (is coverage improving?)
2. Review DQCS distribution (quality stable?)
3. Analyze REI bottlenecks (performance issues?)
4. Investigate any alerts
5. Plan optimization actions
```

### Use Case 2: Incident Response
**Scenario**: Alert triggered for RCR < 90%

```
1. Receive alert notification
2. Check which ruleset affected
3. Review execution results
4. Identify unmatched records
5. Determine root cause
6. Create remediation plan
```

### Use Case 3: Rule Optimization
**Scenario**: Improve DQCS from 86% to 90%

```
1. Identify low-confidence rules
2. Analyze rule performance
3. Prioritize improvements
4. Test new rules
5. Monitor DQCS trend
6. Validate improvement
```

### Use Case 4: Capacity Planning
**Scenario**: Plan for 10x data volume increase

```
1. Review REI trend
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Analyze performance factors
4. Project future capacity
5. Plan infrastructure upgrades
6. Test with larger datasets
```
