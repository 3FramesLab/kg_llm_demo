## ‚ùì FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Which approach should we implement first?
**A**: Start with **Template-Based** (quick win), then evolve to **Hybrid Smart Parser** (long-term solution). See Brainstorm document, Section 1.

### Q: How much will this cost in LLM tokens?
**A**: ~450 tokens per relationship (~$0.0002). Batch of 10 costs ~$0.002. See Technical Design, Section 7.3.

### Q: How long will implementation take?
**A**: 10 weeks in 5 phases. See Brainstorm document, Section 9 or Quick Reference.

### Q: What are the main integration points?
**A**: MultiSchemaLLMService, SchemaParser, and Routes. See Technical Design, Section 5.

### Q: How do we handle ambiguous inputs?
**A**: Multi-turn clarification or suggest alternatives. See Practical Examples, Section 5.

### Q: Can this work with existing KG generation?
**A**: Yes, it integrates seamlessly. See Technical Design, Section 5.1.

### Q: What relationship types are supported?
**A**: All existing types plus new custom types. See Quick Reference, Relationship Types section.
