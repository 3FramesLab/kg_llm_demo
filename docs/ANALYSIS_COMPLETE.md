# Multi-Table Join Analysis: Complete

## üìã Analysis Summary

You asked: **"Why is only hana_material_master being joined? Where should we improve - KG, NL relationships, or SQL generation?"**

---

## üéØ Answer

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Knowledge Graph (KG)** - ‚úÖ Correctly identifies all relationships
2. **NL Relationships** - ‚úÖ Correctly parses relationship definitions

### What Needs Improvement ‚ùå
1. **SQL Generation** - ‚ùå Only supports 2-table INNER JOINs
2. **Rule Generation** - ‚ùå Only creates 2-table rules
3. **LLM Prompt** - ‚ùå Doesn't ask for multi-table joins
4. **Field Preferences** - ‚ùå Not used to determine join order

---

## üî¥ Root Cause

The system architecture only supports **binary joins** (2 tables at a time):

```
Rule Model: source_table ‚Üí target_table (only 2 tables)
SQL Generation: SELECT s.*, t.* FROM s JOIN t (only 2 tables)
Rule Generation: Creates separate 2-table rules
LLM Prompt: Only shows 2-table examples
```

## üìä Detailed Breakdown

### 1. SQL Generation (reconciliation_executor.py:435-502)
**Status**: ‚ùå Needs Enhancement
**Issue**: Only generates 2-table INNER JOINs
**Impact**: HIGH - Prevents multi-table joins

### 2. Rule Model (models.py)
**Status**: ‚ùå Needs Enhancement
**Issue**: Only stores source_table and target_table
**Impact**: HIGH - Cannot represent multi-table joins

### 3. Rule Generation (reconciliation_service.py:208-364)
**Status**: ‚ùå Needs Enhancement
**Issue**: Creates separate 2-table rules
**Impact**: HIGH - Doesn't group related tables

### 4. LLM Prompt (multi_schema_llm_service.py:544-678)
**Status**: ‚ùå Needs Enhancement
**Issue**: Only shows 2-table examples
**Impact**: MEDIUM - LLM generates 2-table rules

### 5. Field Preferences Usage (multi_schema_llm_service.py:558-594)
**Status**: ‚ùå Needs Enhancement
**Issue**: Not used to determine join order
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Underutilized resource

## üöÄ Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: SQL Generation
**File**: `kg_builder/services/reconciliation_executor.py`
**Change**: Support multi-table joins with configurable join order
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: HIGH

### Priority 2: Rule Model
**File**: `kg_builder/models.py`
**Change**: Add multi-table fields (join_tables, join_conditions, join_order)
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: HIGH

### Priority 3: Rule Generation
**File**: `kg_builder/services/reconciliation_service.py`
**Change**: Group related tables and create multi-table rules
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: HIGH

### Priority 4: LLM Prompt
**File**: `kg_builder/services/multi_schema_llm_service.py`
**Change**: Add multi-table examples and instructions
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: MEDIUM

### Priority 5: Field Preferences Usage
**File**: `kg_builder/services/multi_schema_llm_service.py`
**Change**: Use to determine join order and type
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: MEDIUM

## üéØ Key Findings

### Finding 1: KG is Working Correctly
The Knowledge Graph correctly identifies all relationships between tables. The issue is NOT in KG generation.

### Finding 2: NL Relationships are Working Correctly
The NL relationship parser correctly converts natural language to relationships. The issue is NOT in NL parsing.

### Finding 3: SQL Generation is Limited
The SQL generation only supports 2-table INNER JOINs. This is the PRIMARY bottleneck.

### Finding 4: Rule Generation is Too Simplistic
Rules are created as separate 2-table pairs instead of grouping related tables into multi-table rules.

### Finding 5: LLM Prompt Doesn't Ask for Multi-Table Joins
The LLM prompt only shows 2-table examples, so it generates 2-table rules.

### Finding 6: Field Preferences are Underutilized
Field preferences contain information about join order and table grouping but are not used for this purpose.

## üí° Why Only hana_material_master is Joined

**Scenario**: You have 4 tables with relationships:
- brz_lnd_RBP_GPU ‚Üî brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU (material, planning_sku)
- brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU ‚Üî brz_lnd_SKU_LIFNR_Excel (material)
- brz_lnd_RBP_GPU ‚Üî hana_material_master (material)

**Current Behavior**:
1. Rule generation creates 3 separate 2-table rules
2. SQL generation picks one rule (usually the first or last)
3. Only 2 tables are joined
4. Result: Only hana_material_master is joined

**Why hana_material_master?**
- It's likely the last rule generated
- Or it's selected because it's the "enrichment" table
- The system doesn't know to join all 4 tables together

---

## üéØ Solution

Create **multi-table rules** that specify:
1. All tables to join
2. Join conditions between each pair
3. Join order (which table to join first)
4. Join type (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

Then generate SQL that joins all tables together:
```sql
SELECT t1.*, t2.*, t3.*, t4.*
FROM brz_lnd_RBP_GPU t1
INNER JOIN brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU t2 ON ...
INNER JOIN brz_lnd_SKU_LIFNR_Excel t3 ON ...
LEFT JOIN hana_material_master t4 ON ...
```
