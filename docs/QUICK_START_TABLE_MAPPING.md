# Quick Start: Table Name Mapping

## üéØ What This Solves

Your NL queries now work with business terms instead of exact table names!

### Before ‚ùå
```
"Show me products in RBP which are not in OPS Excel"
‚Üí Error: Table "RBP" not found
```

### After ‚úÖ
```
"Show me products in RBP which are not in OPS Excel"
‚Üí Resolves to: brz_lnd_RBP_GPU and brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU
‚Üí Returns: 245 products
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### Via Web UI
1. Go to **Natural Language** page
2. Click **"Execute Queries"** tab

   ```
   "Show me all products in RBP which are not in OPS Excel"
   ```
4. Click **"Execute Queries"**
5. View results with resolved table names

### Via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/kg/nl-queries/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "kg_name": "KG_101",
    "schemas": ["newdqschema"],
    "definitions": [
      "Show me all products in RBP which are not in OPS Excel"
    ],
    "use_llm": true,
    "min_confidence": 0.7
  }'
```

## üí° Example Queries

### Example 1: Find Missing Products
```
"Show me all products in RBP which are not in OPS Excel"
```
**Result**: 245 products in RBP GPU but not in OPS Excel

### Example 2: Find Active Products
```
"Show me all active products in RBP GPU"
```
**Result**: Products with active status in RBP GPU

### Example 3: Find Common Products
```
"Show me all products in RBP which are in OPS Excel"
```
**Result**: Products that exist in both tables

### Example 4: Using Different Terms
```
"Show me products in rbp_gpu not in ops_excel_gpu"
```
**Result**: Same as Example 1 (terms are normalized)

## üìà API Response

The API now returns table mapping information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": [{
    "definition": "Show me all products in RBP which are not in OPS Excel",
    "source_table": "brz_lnd_RBP_GPU",
    "target_table": "brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU",
    "record_count": 245,
    "records": [...]
  }],
  "table_mapping": {
    "brz_lnd_RBP_GPU": ["rbp", "rbp_gpu", "gpu"],
    "brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU": ["ops", "ops_excel", "opsexcel"]
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Multiple Aliases**: Use any variation of the table name
2. **Case Insensitive**: "RBP", "rbp", "Rbp" all work
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles typos and variations
4. **Transparent**: Shows which tables were resolved
5. **Confident**: Increases confidence when mapping succeeds
