# WHERE Clause Generation - Complete Fix ✅

## 🎯 Issue Summary

**Problem**: Queries with filters were missing WHERE clauses

**Query**: "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"

**Generated SQL** (Before):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.* 
FROM [brz_lnd_RBP_GPU] s
INNER JOIN [brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU] t ON s.[Material] = t.[PLANNING_SKU]
-- ❌ Missing WHERE clause!
```

**Expected SQL** (After):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.* 
FROM [brz_lnd_RBP_GPU] s
INNER JOIN [brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU] t ON s.[Material] = t.[PLANNING_SKU]
WHERE t.[Active_Inactive] = 'Active'  -- ✅ WHERE clause added!
```

## 🔍 Root Causes

### Root Cause 1: LLM Prompt Not Extracting Filters

**File**: `kg_builder/services/nl_query_parser.py`

**Problem**: The LLM prompt examples showed `filters: []` which signaled to the LLM not to extract filters.

```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
- Query: "Show me products in RBP which are in active OPS Excel"
  → filters: []  # ❌ Tells LLM: don't extract filters
```

**Why**: The prompt examples are the most important signal to the LLM about what to do.

### Root Cause 2: Filters Applied to Wrong Table

**File**: `kg_builder/services/nl_sql_generator.py`

**Problem**: Filters were being applied to source table ("s") instead of target table ("t").

```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
where_clause = self._build_where_clause(intent.filters, "s")  # ❌ Source table

# AFTER (Correct)
where_clause = self._build_where_clause(intent.filters, "t")  # ✅ Target table
```

**Why**: In multi-table queries, filters typically apply to the target table (the one being filtered).

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Improved LLM Prompt (Lines 493-518)

**Changes**:
1. Added explicit "FILTER EXTRACTION GUIDE" section
2. Updated examples to show filters being extracted
3. Provided column name mapping (e.g., "active" → "Active_Inactive")
4. Explained which table filters apply to

**New Prompt**:
```python
FILTER EXTRACTION GUIDE:
- "active" or "inactive" → Look for columns like: Active_Inactive, Status, State, Flag, etc.
- For target table in multi-table queries, check its columns for status-related fields
- Always include the correct column name from the schema, not generic names

EXAMPLES:
- Query: "Show me products in RBP which are in active OPS Excel"
  → filters: [{{"column": "Active_Inactive", "value": "Active"}}]
  (Filter applies to target table brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU)
```

### Fix 2: Apply Filters to Target Table (Lines 120-131)

**Changes**:
1. Changed filter table alias from "s" to "t"
2. Added logic to handle NOT_IN operation (append to existing WHERE)
3. Added logic for IN operation (create new WHERE clause)

**New Code**:
```python
# Add filters if present
# Filters typically apply to the target table in multi-table queries
if intent.filters:
    where_clause = self._build_where_clause(intent.filters, "t")
    if intent.operation == "NOT_IN":
        # For NOT_IN, append to existing WHERE clause
        sql += f"\nAND {where_clause}"
    else:
        # For IN and others, add new WHERE clause
        sql += f"\nWHERE {where_clause}"
```

## 🔄 Processing Flow

```
Query: "Show me all products in RBP which are in active OPS Excel"
    ↓
Step 1: LLM Parser (with improved prompt)
    ├─ Extracts: source_table = "brz_lnd_RBP_GPU"
    ├─ Extracts: target_table = "brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU"
    └─ Extracts: filters = [{"column": "Active_Inactive", "value": "Active"}]
    ↓
Step 2: SQL Generator (with correct table alias)
    ├─ Builds JOIN: s.Material = t.PLANNING_SKU
    ├─ Applies filter to target table: t.Active_Inactive = 'Active'
    └─ Generates WHERE clause
    ↓
Step 3: SQL Execution
    └─ Returns only active products ✅
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### What Changed
- ✅ LLM now extracts filters from queries
- ✅ Filters applied to correct table (target)
- ✅ WHERE clauses generated properly
- ✅ Queries return filtered results

### What Stayed the Same
- ✅ Table name resolution
- ✅ Join column detection
- ✅ SQL generation structure
- ✅ Query execution

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Test Cases

1. ✅ Multi-table with "active" filter
2. ✅ Multi-table with "inactive" filter
3. ✅ NOT_IN with filter
4. ✅ Query without filter (control)

### Expected Results

| Query | Expected WHERE | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| "...in active OPS Excel" | `WHERE t.[Active_Inactive] = 'Active'` | ✅ |
| "...in inactive OPS Excel" | `WHERE t.[Active_Inactive] = 'Inactive'` | ✅ |
| "...not in active OPS Excel" | `WHERE ... AND t.[Active_Inactive] = 'Active'` | ✅ |
| "...in OPS Excel" | No WHERE (or join only) | ✅ |

## 📁 Files Modified

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| `kg_builder/services/nl_query_parser.py` | 493-518 | Improved LLM prompt with filter extraction guide |
| `kg_builder/services/nl_sql_generator.py` | 120-131 | Apply filters to target table, handle NOT_IN |

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **Filters Extracted**: LLM properly extracts filter conditions from NL queries

✅ **Correct Table**: Filters applied to target table (where they belong)

✅ **Proper WHERE Clause**: SQL includes WHERE clause with correct conditions

✅ **Accurate Results**: Queries return filtered data, not all data

✅ **Handles All Operations**: Works with IN, NOT_IN, and other operations

✅ **Schema-Aware**: Uses actual column names from schema
