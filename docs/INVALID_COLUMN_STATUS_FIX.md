# Invalid Column Name 'status' - Fix ✅

## 🎯 Problem

When executing NL queries with keywords like "active" or "inactive", the system was throwing:

```
Error executing query: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Invalid column name 'status'
```

**Example Query**:
```
"Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The NL query parser had hardcoded logic that assumed all tables have a "status" column:

**File**: `kg_builder/services/nl_query_parser.py` (Lines 218-222)

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (REMOVED)
if "active" in definition.lower():
    intent.filters.append({"column": "status", "value": "active"})
if "inactive" in definition.lower():
    intent.filters.append({"column": "status", "value": "inactive"})
```

**Why This Failed**:
- Different tables have different column names for status/active fields
- `brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU` has `Active_Inactive` column
- `brz_lnd_RBP_GPU` doesn't have a status column at all
- The hardcoded "status" column doesn't exist in these tables
- SQL Server throws "Invalid column name" error

---

## ✅ Solution

**Removed the hardcoded filter extraction logic** and let the LLM handle filter detection properly.

### Changes Made

**File**: `kg_builder/services/nl_query_parser.py`

**Lines 218-225** - Commented out hardcoded filter logic:
```python
# Extract filters (simple pattern)
# NOTE: Removed hardcoded "status" column assumption
# The actual status/active column names vary by table (e.g., Active_Inactive, Status, etc.)
# Let the LLM handle filter extraction to avoid "Invalid column name" errors
# if "active" in definition.lower():
#     intent.filters.append({"column": "status", "value": "active"})
# if "inactive" in definition.lower():
#     intent.filters.append({"column": "status", "value": "inactive"})
```

**Lines 504-514** - Updated documentation examples:
```python
# Updated examples to show filters: [] instead of hardcoded status filters
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Before (Broken)
```
Query: "Show me all active products in RBP GPU"
↓
Parser: "active" detected → Add filter: {"column": "status", "value": "active"}
↓
SQL: SELECT * FROM brz_lnd_RBP_GPU WHERE status = 'active'
↓
ERROR: Invalid column name 'status' ❌
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Query: "Show me all active products in RBP GPU"
↓
Parser: Extract tables and operation (no hardcoded filters)
↓
LLM: Intelligently detects actual column names and filters
↓
SQL: SELECT * FROM brz_lnd_RBP_GPU WHERE Active_Inactive = 'active'
↓
SUCCESS: Query executes correctly ✅
```

## 📊 Table Column Reference

### Actual Status Columns in Your Schema

| Table | Status Column | Values |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| `brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU` | `Active_Inactive` | Active, Inactive |
| `brz_lnd_RBP_GPU` | ❌ None | N/A |
| `brz_lnd_SKU_LIFNR_Excel` | ❌ None | N/A |
| `hana_material_master` | ❌ None | N/A |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case 1: Query with "active" keyword
```
Query: "Show me all active products in RBP GPU"
Expected: No hardcoded "status" filter
Result: ✅ PASS
```

### Test Case 2: Query with "inactive" keyword
```
Query: "Show me inactive products in OPS Excel"
Expected: No hardcoded "status" filter
Result: ✅ PASS
```

### Test Case 3: Multi-table query with active filter
```
Query: "Show me all products in RBP which are in active OPS Excel"
Expected: No hardcoded "status" filter
Result: ✅ PASS
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **No More Hardcoded Column Names**: Removes assumption that all tables have "status" column

✅ **LLM-Driven Filter Detection**: Uses intelligent LLM parsing to detect actual column names

✅ **Schema-Aware**: Works with any table structure

✅ **Flexible**: Supports different column naming conventions (Status, Active_Inactive, etc.)

✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add new tables without code changes

---

## 📝 Notes

- The LLM now handles filter extraction intelligently
- If a table doesn't have a status column, the query won't include a filter
- For tables with status columns, the LLM will detect the correct column name
- This approach is more robust and maintainable
