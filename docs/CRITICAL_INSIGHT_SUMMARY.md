# üéØ CRITICAL INSIGHT: NL Definitions Need Query Execution

## Your Observation (100% Correct!)

> "During NL relationships, don't you think every definition should result in separate query and looks like KG relationships are not properly taken into account"

**YES! You've identified a fundamental architectural flaw!** ‚úÖ

---

## The Core Issue

### What's Happening Now (WRONG)
```
Input: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel"
       "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"

Processing:
  ‚ùå Treated as RELATIONSHIP definitions
  ‚ùå Parsed as: source_table, target_table, relationship_type
  ‚ùå Added to Knowledge Graph
  ‚ùå NOT executed as queries
  ‚ùå NO data results returned
  ‚ùå KG relationships NOT used

Output:
  {
    "nl_relationships_added": 2,
    "relationships": [...]
  }
  
Problem: No actual data! Just relationships added to KG!
```

### What Should Happen (CORRECT)
```
Input: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel"
       "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"

Processing:
  ‚úÖ Classify as DATA_QUERY (not relationship)
  ‚úÖ Parse intent: source, target, operation, filters
  ‚úÖ Use KG to find join columns
  ‚úÖ Generate separate SQL for each definition
  ‚úÖ Execute queries on database
  ‚úÖ Return actual data results

Output:
  {
    "results": [
      {
        "definition": "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
        "sql": "SELECT ... LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL",
        "record_count": 245,
        "records": [...]  ‚Üê ACTUAL DATA!
      },
      {
        "definition": "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel",
        "sql": "SELECT ... INNER JOIN ... WHERE status = 'active'",
        "record_count": 1523,
        "records": [...]  ‚Üê ACTUAL DATA!
      }
    ]
  }
  
Result: Actionable data insights!
```

## Why This Matters

### Current System
- ‚ùå Definitions treated as relationships
- ‚ùå No query execution
- ‚ùå No data results
- ‚ùå KG relationships ignored
- ‚ùå Not useful for data reconciliation

### Proposed System
- ‚úÖ Definitions classified as queries
- ‚úÖ Separate SQL per definition
- ‚úÖ Actual data results
- ‚úÖ KG relationships used for joins
- ‚úÖ Actionable insights for reconciliation

---

## The Solution: 5-Step Architecture

### Step 1: Classify Definition Type
```
Input: "Show me products in RBP GPU not in OPS Excel"
Output: Type = COMPARISON_QUERY, Operation = NOT_IN
```

### Step 2: Parse Query Intent
```
Input: COMPARISON_QUERY
Output: {
  source_table: "RBP GPU",
  target_table: "OPS Excel",
  operation: "NOT_IN",
  filters: []
}
```

### Step 3: Use KG to Find Join Columns
```
Input: RBP GPU, OPS Excel
KG Lookup: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
Output: join_columns = [("material", "planning_sku")]
```

### Step 4: Generate SQL
```
Input: Query intent + join columns
Output: 
  SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
  FROM rbp_gpu r
  LEFT JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
  WHERE o.planning_sku IS NULL
```

### Step 5: Execute & Return Results
```
Input: SQL query
Output: {
  record_count: 245,
  records: [...]
}
```

## Implementation Components

### New Services to Create

1. **NLQueryClassifier** (`nl_query_classifier.py`)
   - Classify definitions as: RELATIONSHIP, DATA_QUERY, FILTER_QUERY, COMPARISON_QUERY, AGGREGATION_QUERY

2. **NLQueryParser** (`nl_query_parser.py`)
   - Parse query intent
   - Extract tables, operations, filters
   - Use KG to find join columns

3. **NLSQLGenerator** (`nl_sql_generator.py`)
   - Generate SQL from query intent
   - Support: set operations, filters, aggregations, multi-table joins

4. **NLQueryExecutor** (`nl_query_executor.py`)
   - Execute generated SQL
   - Return results with statistics

### Updated Endpoint

**Current**: `/kg/integrate-nl-relationships`
- Adds relationships to KG
- No query execution

**New**: `/kg/nl-queries/execute` (or update existing)
- Executes queries
- Returns data results
- Uses KG for join inference

## Example: Your Use Case

### Input
```json
{
  "kg_name": "KG_101",
  "schemas": ["newdqschema"],
  "definitions": [
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
  ]
}
```

### Processing

**Definition 1: Set Difference**
```
Classify: COMPARISON_QUERY (NOT_IN)
Parse: source=RBP GPU, target=OPS Excel, operation=NOT_IN
KG Lookup: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
SQL: SELECT ... LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL
Result: 245 products in RBP GPU not in OPS Excel
```

**Definition 2: Filtered Join**
```
Classify: COMPARISON_QUERY (IN with filter)
Parse: source=RBP GPU, target=OPS Excel, operation=IN, filter=active
KG Lookup: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
SQL: SELECT ... INNER JOIN ... WHERE status = 'active'
Result: 1523 products in both tables with active status
```

### Output
```json
{
  "total_definitions": 2,
  "successful": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "definition": "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
      "query_type": "comparison",
      "operation": "NOT_IN",
      "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT r.* FROM rbp_gpu r LEFT JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku WHERE o.planning_sku IS NULL",
      "record_count": 245,
      "join_columns": [["material", "planning_sku"]],
      "records": [...]
    },
    {
      "definition": "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel",
      "query_type": "comparison",
      "operation": "IN",
      "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT r.* FROM rbp_gpu r INNER JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku WHERE o.status = 'active'",
      "record_count": 1523,
      "join_columns": [["material", "planning_sku"]],
      "records": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Summary

Your observation is **spot-on**! The current system:
- ‚ùå Treats all definitions as relationships
- ‚ùå Doesn't generate separate queries
- ‚ùå Doesn't use KG relationships
- ‚ùå Returns no data results

The solution is to:
- ‚úÖ Classify definitions as queries vs. relationships
- ‚úÖ Generate separate SQL for each query
- ‚úÖ Use KG to infer join columns
- ‚úÖ Execute queries and return actual data

This will transform NL definitions from "relationship definitions" to "executable data queries" that provide real insights for data reconciliation! üöÄ
