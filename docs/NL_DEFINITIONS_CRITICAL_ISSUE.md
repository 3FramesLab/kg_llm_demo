# üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: NL Definitions Processing

## The Problem

You've identified a **critical architectural issue** with how NL definitions are being processed:

### Your Example
```json
{
  "kg_name": "KG_101",
  "schemas": ["newdqschema"],
  "definitions": [
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
  ],
  "use_llm": true,
  "min_confidence": 0.7
}
```

### What's Happening (WRONG)
1. **Each definition is treated as a RELATIONSHIP definition**
   - System tries to parse: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel"
   - Looks for: source_table, target_table, relationship_type
   - Result: Confused/incorrect parsing

2. **Definitions are NOT converted to separate queries**
   - They're added to the Knowledge Graph as relationships
   - Not executed as SQL queries
   - Not used to find data mismatches

3. **KG relationships are NOT used to understand context**
   - System doesn't leverage existing KG relationships
   - Doesn't understand that RBP GPU and OPS Excel are related
   - Doesn't use join paths from KG

---

## What SHOULD Happen

### For Each Definition
```
Definition 1: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel"
    ‚Üì
Parse as DATA QUERY (not relationship)
    ‚Üì
Understand: 
  - Source table: RBP GPU
  - Target table: OPS Excel
  - Operation: LEFT JOIN with NOT EXISTS
  - Join path: Use KG relationships to find join columns
    ‚Üì
Generate SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
  FROM rbp_gpu r
  LEFT JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
  WHERE o.planning_sku IS NULL
    ‚Üì
Execute query
    ‚Üì
Return results

Definition 2: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
    ‚Üì
Parse as DATA QUERY
    ‚Üì
Understand:
  - Source table: RBP GPU
  - Target table: OPS Excel
  - Filter: active status
  - Operation: INNER JOIN
    ‚Üì
Generate SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
  FROM rbp_gpu r
  INNER JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
  WHERE o.status = 'active'
    ‚Üì
Execute query
    ‚Üì
Return results
```

## Current Architecture vs. Needed Architecture

### Current (WRONG)
```
NL Definition
    ‚Üì
Parse as Relationship Definition
    ‚Üì
Extract: source_table, target_table, relationship_type
    ‚Üì
Add to Knowledge Graph
    ‚Üì
(No query execution)
    ‚Üì
(No data results)
```

### Needed (CORRECT)
```
NL Definition
    ‚Üì
Classify: Is this a RELATIONSHIP or a DATA QUERY?
    ‚Üì
If RELATIONSHIP:
  Parse as relationship definition
  Add to KG
    ‚Üì
If DATA QUERY:
  Parse as query intent
  Use KG to find join paths
  Generate SQL for each definition
  Execute SQL
  Return results
```

## Key Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Definition Classification
**Current**: All definitions treated as relationships
**Needed**: Classify each definition as:
- `RELATIONSHIP` - "Products are supplied by Vendors"
- `DATA_QUERY` - "Show me products not in OPS Excel"
- `FILTER_QUERY` - "Show me active products"
- `COMPARISON_QUERY` - "Show me differences between tables"

### Issue 2: KG Relationship Usage
**Current**: KG relationships not used during parsing
**Needed**: 
- Load existing KG relationships
- Use them to understand table connections
- Infer join columns from KG
- Build join paths automatically

### Issue 3: SQL Generation
**Current**: No SQL generation from definitions
**Needed**:
- Generate SQL for each data query definition
- Support different query types:
  - Set difference: `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL`
  - Set intersection: `INNER JOIN`
  - Filtered join: `INNER JOIN ... WHERE condition`
  - Multi-table: Chain joins using KG paths

### Issue 4: Query Execution
**Current**: Definitions added to KG, not executed
**Needed**:
- Execute generated SQL
- Return actual data results
- Show matched/unmatched records
- Provide statistics

## Example: How It Should Work

### Input
```json
{
  "kg_name": "KG_101",
  "schemas": ["newdqschema"],
  "definitions": [
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
  ]
}
```

### Processing

**Step 1: Load KG**
```
KG has relationships:
- RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku (MATCHES)
- RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí SKU LIFNR.material (MATCHES)
```

**Step 2: Classify Definitions**
```
Definition 1: DATA_QUERY (Set Difference)
Definition 2: DATA_QUERY (Filtered Join)
```

**Step 3: Parse Each Definition**
```
Definition 1:
  - Source: RBP GPU
  - Target: OPS Excel
  - Operation: NOT IN
  - Join column: material = planning_sku (from KG)

Definition 2:
  - Source: RBP GPU
  - Target: OPS Excel
  - Filter: active status
  - Operation: IN
  - Join column: material = planning_sku (from KG)
```

**Step 4: Generate SQL**
```sql
-- Definition 1
SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
FROM rbp_gpu r
LEFT JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
WHERE o.planning_sku IS NULL

-- Definition 2
SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
FROM rbp_gpu r
INNER JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
WHERE o.status = 'active'
```

**Step 5: Execute & Return Results**
```json
{
  "definition_1": {
    "query": "SELECT DISTINCT r.* FROM rbp_gpu r LEFT JOIN ops_excel o...",
    "matched_count": 0,
    "unmatched_count": 245,
    "records": [...]
  },
  "definition_2": {
    "query": "SELECT DISTINCT r.* FROM rbp_gpu r INNER JOIN ops_excel o...",
    "matched_count": 1523,
    "records": [...]
  }
}
```

## Summary

### What's Wrong
1. ‚ùå Definitions treated as relationships, not queries
2. ‚ùå No separate query generation per definition
3. ‚ùå KG relationships not used for join path inference
4. ‚ùå No SQL execution
5. ‚ùå No data results returned

### What's Needed
1. ‚úÖ Classify definitions as relationships vs. queries
2. ‚úÖ Generate separate SQL for each query definition
3. ‚úÖ Use KG relationships to infer join columns
4. ‚úÖ Execute SQL and return results
5. ‚úÖ Support multiple query types (difference, intersection, filtered, etc.)

### Impact
- **Current**: Definitions are added to KG but don't produce actionable results
- **Needed**: Definitions generate executable queries with actual data insights
