# JSX Syntax Error Fix - Summary

## 🐛 Problem

**Error**: 
```
SyntaxError: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. 
Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>? (646:6)
```

**Location**: `web-app/src/pages/NaturalLanguage.js` line 646

## 🔍 Root Cause

The "Supported Formats" `<Paper>` element was placed **outside** the main Grid container but **inside** the conditional render for the "Integrate Relationships" tab.

### Before (WRONG):
```jsx
{activeTab === 'integrate' && (
  <Grid container spacing={3}>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      {/* Content */}
    </Grid>
  </Grid>

  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mt: 3 }}>  {/* ❌ Sibling element outside Grid */}
    {/* Supported Formats */}
  </Paper>
)}
```

This created two adjacent JSX elements (`</Grid>` and `<Paper>`) at the same level, which is not allowed.

---

## ✅ Solution

Wrapped the `<Paper>` element inside a `<Grid item>` and placed it inside the main Grid container.

### After (CORRECT):
```jsx
{activeTab === 'integrate' && (
  <Grid container spacing={3}>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      {/* Content */}
    </Grid>

    <Grid item xs={12}>  {/* ✅ Wrapped in Grid item */}
      <Paper sx={{ p: 3 }}>
        {/* Supported Formats */}
      </Paper>
    </Grid>
  </Grid>
)}
```

## 📝 Changes Made

**File**: `web-app/src/pages/NaturalLanguage.js`

**Lines**: 643-689

**Changes**:
1. Moved `<Paper>` element inside the main Grid container
2. Wrapped `<Paper>` in a `<Grid item xs={12}>` for proper layout
3. Adjusted indentation for nested Grid inside Paper
4. Removed duplicate comment

## ✨ Result

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

In React JSX, when using conditional rendering with multiple elements:
- ✅ Wrap multiple elements in a single parent (Fragment or Container)
- ✅ Use proper Grid layout structure
- ❌ Don't place sibling elements at the same level in conditionals
