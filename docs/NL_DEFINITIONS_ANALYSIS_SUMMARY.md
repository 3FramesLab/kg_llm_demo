# NL Definitions - Critical Analysis & Solution

## üéØ Your Observation (CORRECT!)

You identified a **critical architectural flaw**:

> "During NL relationships, don't you think every definition should result in separate query and looks like KG relationships are not properly taken into account"

**You are 100% correct!** ‚úÖ

## üî¥ The Problem

### Current Behavior (WRONG)
```
Input:
{
  "definitions": [
    "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
    "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
  ]
}

Processing:
1. Parse definition 1 as RELATIONSHIP definition
   ‚Üí Tries to extract: source_table, target_table, relationship_type
   ‚Üí Result: Confused/incorrect parsing

2. Parse definition 2 as RELATIONSHIP definition
   ‚Üí Same issue

3. Add both to Knowledge Graph as relationships
   ‚Üí NOT executed as queries
   ‚Üí NO data results returned
   ‚Üí KG relationships NOT used

Output:
{
  "nl_relationships_added": 2,
  "relationships": [...]
}
```

### What Should Happen (CORRECT)
```
Input:
{
  "definitions": [
    "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
    "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
  ]
}

Processing:
1. Classify definition 1 as DATA_QUERY (Set Difference)
   ‚Üí Use KG to find: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
   ‚Üí Generate SQL: SELECT ... LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL
   ‚Üí Execute query
   ‚Üí Return 245 unmatched records

2. Classify definition 2 as DATA_QUERY (Filtered Join)
   ‚Üí Use KG to find: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
   ‚Üí Generate SQL: SELECT ... INNER JOIN ... WHERE status = 'active'
   ‚Üí Execute query
   ‚Üí Return 1523 matched records

Output:
{
  "total_definitions": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "definition": "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
      "query_type": "comparison",
      "sql": "SELECT ... LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL",
      "record_count": 245,
      "records": [...]
    },
    {
      "definition": "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel",
      "query_type": "comparison",
      "sql": "SELECT ... INNER JOIN ... WHERE status = 'active'",
      "record_count": 1523,
      "records": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîë Key Issues

### Issue 1: Definition Type Not Classified
**Current**: All definitions treated as relationships
**Problem**: "Show me products not in OPS Excel" is NOT a relationship definition
**Solution**: Classify as DATA_QUERY, not RELATIONSHIP

### Issue 2: No Separate Query Generation
**Current**: Definitions added to KG, not converted to SQL
**Problem**: Each definition should generate its own SQL query
**Solution**: Generate separate SQL for each definition

### Issue 3: KG Relationships Not Used
**Current**: KG relationships ignored during parsing
**Problem**: System doesn't know RBP GPU.material joins with OPS Excel.planning_sku
**Solution**: Use KG to infer join columns automatically

### Issue 4: No Query Execution
**Current**: Definitions stored, not executed
**Problem**: No data results returned
**Solution**: Execute SQL and return actual records

## ‚úÖ Solution Architecture

### New Components Needed

```
NL Definition
    ‚Üì
[1] NLQueryClassifier
    ‚îú‚îÄ RELATIONSHIP: "Products are supplied by Vendors"

## üìä Example: How It Works

### Input
```json
{
  "kg_name": "KG_101",
  "schemas": ["newdqschema"],
  "definitions": [
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
    "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"
  ]
}
```

### Processing

**Definition 1: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel"**

```
Step 1: Classify ‚Üí COMPARISON_QUERY (Set Difference)
Step 2: Parse
  - Source table: RBP GPU
  - Target table: OPS Excel
  - Operation: NOT_IN
Step 3: Use KG to find join
  - KG has: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
  - Join columns: (material, planning_sku)
Step 4: Generate SQL
  SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
  FROM rbp_gpu r
  LEFT JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
  WHERE o.planning_sku IS NULL
Step 5: Execute
  - Found 245 products in RBP GPU not in OPS Excel
```

**Definition 2: "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel"**

```
Step 1: Classify ‚Üí COMPARISON_QUERY (Filtered Join)
Step 2: Parse
  - Source table: RBP GPU
  - Target table: OPS Excel
  - Operation: IN
  - Filter: status = 'active'
Step 3: Use KG to find join
  - KG has: RBP GPU.material ‚Üê‚Üí OPS Excel.planning_sku
  - Join columns: (material, planning_sku)
Step 4: Generate SQL
  SELECT DISTINCT r.* 
  FROM rbp_gpu r
  INNER JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku
  WHERE o.status = 'active'
Step 5: Execute
  - Found 1523 products in both tables with active status
```

### Output
```json
{
  "kg_name": "KG_101",
  "total_definitions": 2,
  "successful": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "definition": "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are not in OPS Excel",
      "query_type": "comparison",
      "operation": "NOT_IN",
      "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT r.* FROM rbp_gpu r LEFT JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku WHERE o.planning_sku IS NULL",
      "record_count": 245,
      "join_columns": [["material", "planning_sku"]],
      "records": [...]
    },
    {
      "definition": "Show me all the products in RBP GPU which are in active OPS Excel",
      "query_type": "comparison",
      "operation": "IN",
      "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT r.* FROM rbp_gpu r INNER JOIN ops_excel o ON r.material = o.planning_sku WHERE o.status = 'active'",
      "record_count": 1523,
      "join_columns": [["material", "planning_sku"]],
      "records": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Classification (1-2 days)
- Create `NLQueryClassifier` to distinguish between:
  - Relationship definitions
  - Data queries
  - Filter queries
  - Comparison queries

### Phase 2: Intent Parsing (2-3 days)
- Create `NLQueryParser` to extract:
  - Source and target tables
  - Operations (NOT_IN, IN, EQUALS)
  - Filters and conditions
  - Use KG to find join columns

### Phase 3: SQL Generation (2-3 days)
- Create `NLSQLGenerator` to generate:
  - Comparison queries (set difference, intersection)
  - Filter queries (WHERE clauses)
  - Multi-table joins

### Phase 4: Execution (1-2 days)
- Create `NLQueryExecutor` to:
  - Execute generated SQL
  - Return results with statistics
  - Handle errors

### Phase 5: API Integration (1 day)
- Update `/kg/integrate-nl-relationships` endpoint
- Or create new `/kg/nl-queries/execute` endpoint
- Return data results instead of just relationships

## ‚úÖ Summary

### What's Wrong
- ‚ùå Definitions treated as relationships, not queries
- ‚ùå No separate SQL per definition
- ‚ùå KG relationships not used
- ‚ùå No query execution
- ‚ùå No data results

### What's Needed
- ‚úÖ Classify definitions (relationship vs. query)
- ‚úÖ Generate separate SQL for each query
- ‚úÖ Use KG to infer join columns
- ‚úÖ Execute SQL and return results
- ‚úÖ Support multiple query types

### Impact
- **Current**: Definitions added to KG but no actionable results
- **Needed**: Definitions generate executable queries with actual data insights

## üéØ Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Implement Phase 1** (Classification) - Start building the solution
2. **Create test cases** - Define expected behavior
3. **Update the API** - Modify the endpoint to support this
4. **All of the above** - Full implementation

Your insight was spot-on! This is a critical improvement that will make NL definitions actually useful. üöÄ
