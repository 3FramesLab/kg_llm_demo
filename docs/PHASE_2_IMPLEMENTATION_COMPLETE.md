## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Integration Workflow

```
1. Load/Generate Knowledge Graph
   ↓
2. Parse Natural Language Definitions
   ↓
3. Add NL Relationships to KG
   ↓
4. Merge Relationships (deduplicate, filter)
   ↓
5. Calculate Statistics
   ↓
6. Return Updated KG with Metrics
```

### Merge Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **union** | Keep all relationships | Comprehensive analysis |
| **deduplicate** | Remove exact duplicates | Clean data |
| **high_confidence** | Keep only high-confidence (≥0.7) | Quality focus |

### Relationship Tracking

Each relationship now includes:
- `source`: "natural_language" or "auto_detected"
- `confidence`: 0.0-1.0 confidence score
- `reasoning`: Why the relationship exists
- `nl_defined`: Boolean flag for NL-defined relationships
- `cardinality`: Relationship cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:N)
