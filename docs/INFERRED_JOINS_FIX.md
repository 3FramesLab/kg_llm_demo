# Inferred Joins Fix - Additional Columns from Related Tables

## Problem Statement

**Query:** "Show me all products in RBP GPU which are inactive in OPS Excel, show who was ops_planner from material master"

**Error:**
```
‚ùå No join path found between brz_lnd_RBP_GPU and hana_material_master
‚ùå No relationship path found for column 'ops_planner'
```

**Root Cause:**
- LLM correctly extracted "ops_planner from material_master" as additional column
- System tried to find a relationship path in the Knowledge Graph
- No explicit relationship existed between RBP_GPU and material_master
- Query failed even though both tables have common "Material" column

---

## What Should Happen ‚úÖ

For the query above, the system should generate SQL like:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.*, mm.ops_planner AS ops_planner
FROM [brz_lnd_RBP_GPU] s
INNER JOIN [brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU] t
  ON s.[Material] = t.[PLANNING_SKU]
LEFT JOIN [hana_material_master] mm
  ON s.[Material] = mm.[Material]  -- ‚Üê Inferred from common column names!
WHERE t.[Active_Inactive] = 'Inactive'
```

**Key Points:**
1. ‚úÖ Main query: Products in RBP that are inactive in OPS
2. ‚úÖ Additional column: `ops_planner` from `material_master`
3. ‚úÖ Automatic join inference: Both tables have "Material" column
4. ‚úÖ No explicit KG relationship needed

---

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Reverted Wrong Excluded Fields Logic

**File:** `kg_builder/routes.py:250-277`

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
# Removed relationships from KG if they used excluded fields
if is_excluded_field(source_col, excluded_fields_set):
    continue  # ‚ùå Skip this relationship - BREAKS CONNECTIVITY!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Mark relationships as low-priority but KEEP them for connectivity
rel.properties["is_excluded"] = True
rel.properties["priority"] = -1  # Lower priority, but still usable
```

**Why:** Removing relationships broke table connectivity in the KG. Tables became disconnected and queries failed.

---

### 2. Added Inferred Join Fallback

**File:** `kg_builder/services/nl_query_parser.py:890-979`

**New Method:** `_infer_join_from_column_names(source, target)`

**How It Works:**

```python
def _infer_join_from_column_names(source, target):
    """
    When no explicit KG relationship exists, infer join from common columns.

    Steps:
    1. Get columns from both tables (from schemas_info)
    2. Find common column names (case-insensitive)
    3. Prioritize ID-like columns (Material, SKU, etc.)
    4. Return synthetic JoinPath with confidence=0.65
    """
```

**Column Priority:**
```python
High Priority (score=3):
  - material, product, sku, item, code

Medium Priority (score=2):
  - columns ending with "_id", "_uid"

Low Priority (score=1):
  - number, ref, key

Avoid:
  - Generic columns like "status", "date", "name"
```

**Example:**
```
brz_lnd_RBP_GPU columns: [Material, Material_Desc, Status, ...]
hana_material_master columns: [Material, Material_Name, Planner, ...]

Common columns found: Material (HIGH PRIORITY)
‚úì Inferred join: Material ‚Üê‚Üí Material (confidence: 0.65)
```

---

### 3. Updated Join Path Finding Logic

**File:** `kg_builder/services/nl_query_parser.py:859-869`

**Before:**
```python
if not all_paths:
    logger.warning(f"No join path found between {source} and {target}")
    return None  # ‚ùå Immediate failure
```

**After:**
```python
if not all_paths:
    logger.warning(f"No join path found in KG between {source} and {target}")

    # Fallback: Try to infer join from column names
    inferred_path = self._infer_join_from_column_names(source, target)
    if inferred_path:
        logger.info(f"‚úì Inferred join path from column names")
        return inferred_path  # ‚úÖ Success with inferred join

    logger.warning(f"‚ùå No join path found")
    return None
```

**Flow:**
```
1. Try to find path in KG relationships (BFS)
   ‚Üì Not found
2. Try to infer join from common column names
   ‚Üì Found!
3. Return synthetic JoinPath with inferred columns
```

---

## Example: End-to-End Flow

### Query
```
"Show me all products in RBP GPU which are inactive in OPS Excel, show who was ops_planner from material master"
```

### Step 1: LLM Parsing
```json
{
  "source_table": "brz_lnd_RBP_GPU",
  "target_table": "brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU",
  "filters": [{"column": "Active_Inactive", "value": "Inactive"}],
  "additional_columns": [
    {
      "column_name": "ops_planner",
      "source_table": "hana_material_master"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Join Resolution
```
Main join: RBP_GPU ‚Üê‚Üí OPS_EXCEL_GPU
  ‚úì Found in KG: Material ‚Üê‚Üí PLANNING_SKU

Additional column join: RBP_GPU ‚Üê‚Üí hana_material_master
  ‚úó Not found in KG relationships
  üîç Trying to infer from column names...
  ‚úì Found common column: Material
  ‚úì Inferred join: Material ‚Üê‚Üí Material (confidence: 0.65)
```

### Step 3: SQL Generation
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.*, mm.ops_planner AS ops_planner
FROM [brz_lnd_RBP_GPU] s
INNER JOIN [brz_lnd_OPS_EXCEL_GPU] t
  ON s.[Material] = t.[PLANNING_SKU]
LEFT JOIN [hana_material_master] mm
  ON s.[Material] = mm.[Material]  -- ‚Üê Inferred!
WHERE t.[Active_Inactive] = 'Inactive'
```

### Step 4: Execution
```
‚úÖ Query executes successfully
‚úÖ Returns products with ops_planner column
```

## Benefits

### Before Fix
```
‚ùå Required explicit KG relationships for ALL table joins
‚ùå Failed when relationships missing
‚ùå No fallback mechanism
‚ùå Users had to manually add relationships
```

### After Fix
```
‚úÖ Automatically infers joins from common columns
‚úÖ Works even without explicit KG relationships
‚úÖ Intelligent column prioritization
‚úÖ Seamless user experience
```

---

## Configuration

**No configuration needed!** The feature works automatically:

1. **KG relationships take priority** (confidence: 0.75-0.95)
2. **Inferred joins as fallback** (confidence: 0.65)
3. **Column name matching is case-insensitive**
4. **Prefers ID-like columns** (Material, SKU, Product, etc.)

---

## Column Matching Examples

### Good Matches (High Confidence)
```
‚úì Material ‚Üê‚Üí Material
‚úì PLANNING_SKU ‚Üê‚Üí planning_sku
‚úì Product_ID ‚Üê‚Üí product_id
‚úì Material_Code ‚Üê‚Üí MATERIAL_CODE
```

### Acceptable Matches (Medium Confidence)
```
‚úì Item_ID ‚Üê‚Üí Item_ID
‚úì Product_Ref ‚Üê‚Üí PRODUCT_REF
‚úì Customer_Number ‚Üê‚Üí customer_number
```

### Avoided Matches (Low Priority)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Status ‚Üê‚Üí Status (too generic)
‚ö†Ô∏è Date ‚Üê‚Üí Date (ambiguous)
‚ö†Ô∏è Name ‚Üê‚Üí Name (common but unreliable)
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Inferred Join with Material Column
```python
Query: "Show products from RBP with planner from material master"

Expected:
- Main table: brz_lnd_RBP_GPU
- Additional column: planner from hana_material_master
- Inferred join: Material ‚Üê‚Üí Material
- SQL includes: LEFT JOIN hana_material_master mm ON s.Material = mm.Material
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple Common Columns
```python
Tables:
- RBP_GPU: [Material, Product_ID, Status]
- MATERIAL_MASTER: [Material, Product_ID, Planner]

Expected:
- Finds both Material and Product_ID
- Prioritizes "Material" (higher priority)
- Uses Material for join
```

### Test Case 3: No Common Columns
```python
Tables:
- RBP_GPU: [Material, Quantity]
- SUPPLIER: [Supplier_ID, Supplier_Name]

Expected:
- No common columns found
- Returns None
- Error message: "No join path found"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Fuzzy Column Matching**
   - Match "MaterialID" with "Material_ID"
   - Handle abbreviations: "Mat" ‚Üê‚Üí "Material"

2. **Multi-Column Joins**
   - Support composite keys
   - JOIN ON (col1, col2) = (col3, col4)

3. **Foreign Key Detection**
   - Analyze column names for FK patterns
   - "Customer_ID" likely references "Customer.ID"

4. **User Override**
   - Allow users to specify preferred join columns
   - Override inferred joins

5. **Learning from Usage**
   - Track successful inferred joins
   - Increase confidence for frequently used patterns

## Summary

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Excluded fields breaking connectivity | ‚úÖ **Fixed** | Tables remain connected in KG |
| No fallback for missing relationships | ‚úÖ **Fixed** | Automatic column name inference |
| Additional columns requiring explicit KG paths | ‚úÖ **Fixed** | Works without KG relationships |

**Result:** System now handles additional columns from related tables automatically, even without explicit Knowledge Graph relationships!
