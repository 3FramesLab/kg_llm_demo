# Knowledge Graph Visualization Fix: "Node Not Found" Error

## 🔴 Problem

When viewing a Knowledge Graph, you got this error:

```
node not found: hana_material_master
    at find (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:57977:20)
    at initialize (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:58036:58)
    at __webpack_modules__../node_modules/d3-force-3d/src/link.js.force.links
```

This error occurred because:
1. The backend returned relationships with node IDs (e.g., `table_hana_material_master`)
2. But the frontend didn't have those nodes in the entities list
3. The visualization library tried to render a link to a non-existent node and crashed

## ✅ Root Causes & Fixes

### Issue 1: FalkorDB Query Returned Wrong Field Names

**Problem**: FalkorDB query returned `source` and `target` instead of `source_id` and `target_id`

```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
query = """
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) 
RETURN a.id as source, type(r) as relationship_type, b.id as target, properties(r) as properties
"""
```

**Fix**: Changed field names to match frontend expectations

```python
# AFTER (Correct)
query = """
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) 
RETURN a.id as source_id, type(r) as relationship_type, b.id as target_id, properties(r) as properties
"""
```

**File**: `kg_builder/services/falkordb_backend.py` (line 160-179)

### Issue 2: FalkorDB Entities Missing Label Field

**Problem**: FalkorDB query returned `labels` (array) but frontend expected `label` (string)

```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
query = "MATCH (n) RETURN n.id as id, labels(n) as labels, properties(n) as properties"
```

**Fix**: Extract first label and add type field

```python
# AFTER (Correct)
query = "MATCH (n) RETURN n.id as id, labels(n)[0] as label, properties(n) as properties"

# Also format the results to ensure all required fields
formatted_results = []
for result in results:
    formatted_result = {
        "id": result.get("id"),
        "label": result.get("label", "Unknown"),
        "properties": result.get("properties", {}),
        "type": result.get("label", "Unknown")  # Add type field for frontend
    }
    formatted_results.append(formatted_result)

return formatted_results
```

**File**: `kg_builder/services/falkordb_backend.py` (line 142-158)

### Issue 3: Frontend Didn't Validate Relationships

**Problem**: Frontend tried to render relationships even if nodes didn't exist

```javascript
// BEFORE (No validation)
const graphData = {
  nodes: entities.map(...),
  links: relationships.map((rel) => ({
    source: rel.source_id,
    target: rel.target_id,
    type: rel.relationship_type,
  })),
};
```

**Fix**: Filter relationships to only include valid ones

```javascript
// AFTER (With validation)
// Create a set of valid entity IDs
const validEntityIds = new Set(entities.map((e) => e.id));

// Filter relationships to only include those with valid source and target nodes
const validRelationships = relationships.filter((rel) => {
  const isValid = validEntityIds.has(rel.source_id) && validEntityIds.has(rel.target_id);
  if (!isValid) {
    console.warn(
      `Skipping relationship: ${rel.source_id} -> ${rel.target_id} (node not found)`
    );
  }
  return isValid;
});

const graphData = {
  nodes: entities.map(...),
  links: validRelationships.map((rel) => ({
    source: rel.source_id,
    target: rel.target_id,
    type: rel.relationship_type,
  })),
};
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Before Fix
```
Backend (FalkorDB)
  ↓
  Returns: source, target (wrong field names)
  Returns: labels (array, not string)
  ↓
Frontend
  ↓
  Expects: source_id, target_id
  Expects: label (string)
  ↓
  ❌ Mismatch! Tries to render non-existent nodes
  ❌ Error: "node not found"
```

### After Fix
```
Backend (FalkorDB)
  ↓
  Returns: source_id, target_id (correct field names)
  Returns: label (string), type (for frontend)
  ↓
Frontend
  ↓
  Validates relationships against entities
  Filters out invalid relationships
  ↓
  ✅ Only renders valid nodes and relationships
  ✅ No errors!
```

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **kg_builder/services/falkordb_backend.py**
   - Fixed `get_entities()` query (line 142-158)
   - Fixed `get_relationships()` query (line 160-179)
   - Added result formatting to ensure correct field names

2. **web-app/src/components/GraphVisualization.js**
   - Added validation for relationships (line 6-50)
   - Filter out relationships with non-existent nodes
   - Added console warnings for debugging

---

## ✅ What's Fixed

✅ FalkorDB returns correct field names (`source_id`, `target_id`)
✅ FalkorDB returns correct entity format (`label` as string, `type` field)
✅ Frontend validates relationships before rendering
✅ Invalid relationships are filtered out with warnings
✅ No more "node not found" errors
✅ Visualization renders correctly

---

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Create a Knowledge Graph with multiple tables
2. View the KG in the visualization
3. Check browser console for any warnings
4. Verify all nodes and relationships render correctly
5. No "node not found" errors should appear

---

## 📝 Summary

The "node not found" error was caused by:
1. Backend returning wrong field names and formats
2. Frontend not validating relationships

The fix:
1. Corrected FalkorDB queries to return proper field names
2. Added result formatting to ensure correct structure
3. Added frontend validation to filter invalid relationships
4. Added console warnings for debugging

Now the KG visualization works correctly! 🎉
